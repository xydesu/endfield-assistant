- **Guild notifications** – post sign-in results to a designated server channel
- **Account unbinding** – remove all stored data with `/unbind`

- **Exploration progress** – check per-region exploration status with `/explore`
- **Achievement showcase** – display your 光榮之路 achievement card with `/achieve`

## Add the Bot

To add the hosted bot to your server, use the invite link below — no self-hosting required:

**👉 [Invite Endfield Assistant](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1466362435782049817)**

---

## Self-Hosting Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or later
- A Discord bot token ([Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/xydesu/endfield-assistant.git
cd endfield-assistant

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```dotenv
# Discord bot token
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here

# Discord application client ID
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here

# (Optional) Deploy commands to a specific guild instead of globally
GUILD_ID=your_guild_id_here

# 32-byte hex key for AES-256-CBC credential encryption
# Generate with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_64_character_hex_key_here
```

> **Security note:** Never commit your `.env` file. Keep your `ENCRYPTION_KEY` secret and back it up — losing it will prevent existing credentials from being decrypted.

### Deploy Slash Commands

```bash
npm run deploy
```

If `GUILD_ID` is set, the commands are registered to that guild (instant). Without `GUILD_ID`, they are registered globally (may take up to one hour to propagate).

### Start the Bot

```bash
npm start
```

The bot will sync the SQLite database on first run and restore all scheduled sign-in jobs automatically.

## How Binding Works

1. Run `/bind` in any channel the bot can see.
2. Follow the step-by-step embed to open the sign-in website in a browser.
3. Open the browser developer console (`F12 → Console`) and run the provided script to extract your session credentials.
4. Paste the resulting JSON into the modal that opens when you click **輸入 Config**.
5. Your credentials are encrypted with AES-256-CBC before being stored in the local SQLite database.
